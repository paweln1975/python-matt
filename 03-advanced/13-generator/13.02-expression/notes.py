# - Creates generator object and assign reference
# - Code is not executed instantly
# - Sometimes code is not executed at all!
# - Are cleared once they are executed
# - Generator will calculate next number for every loop iteration
# - Generator forgets previous number
# - Generator doesn't know the next number
# - It is used for one-time access to values (for example in the loop iterator)
# %%



# %% List Comprehension
# - Comprehensions executes instantly
# - Comprehensions will be in the memory until end of a program
# - Comprehensions - Using values more than one
# %%
