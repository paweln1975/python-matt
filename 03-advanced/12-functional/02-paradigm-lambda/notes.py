#%% Functional Lambda
# Lambda - Anonymous functions
# When function is used once
# When function is short
# You don't need to name it (therefore anonymous)



#%% Syntax



#%% Convention
# Usually parameters are named x and y
# Use shortest code possible
# Do not assign lambda to variable
# Lambda is anonymous function and it should stay anonymous. Do not name it
# :pep:8 -- Style Guide for Python Code: "Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that binds a lambda expression directly to an identifier". Lambda is anonymous function and it should stay anonymous. Do not name it.
# Usually there are no spaces in lambda expressions (to make code shorter)
