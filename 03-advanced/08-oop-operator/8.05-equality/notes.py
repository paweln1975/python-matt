# %% Problem
# %%



# %% Solution
# - When you compare objects with the same fields from two different classes
# - Always remember to compare classes
# - This way you avoid bug, when both has the same fields and values
# - Eq Works at Both Sides
# %%



# %% Operator
# - operator.eq(a, b) - equal - a.__eq__(b)
# - operator.ne(a, b) - not equal - a.__ne__(b)
