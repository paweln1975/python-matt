# - Covariance - Enables you to use a more derived type than originally specified
# - Contravariance - Enables you to use a more generic (less derived) type than originally specified
# - Invariance - Means that you can use only the type originally specified.
# - Invariance is important for example in np.ndarray, where all items must be exactly the same type
