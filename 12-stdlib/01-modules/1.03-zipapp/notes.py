# - This will produce a standalone executable
# - It can be shipped to users as a single file
# - It can be run on any machine with the appropriate interpreter available
# - On Unix, the myapp.pyz file is executable as it stands
# - If you want you can rename the file to remove the .pyz extension
# - On Windows, the myapp.pyz[w] file is executable by virtue of the fact that the Python interpreter registers the .pyz and .pyzw file extensions when installed
