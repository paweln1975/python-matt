# %% Supervised Learning
# - Input data is called training data and has a known label or result such as
# %%



# %% Unsupervised Learning
# - Input data is not labeled and does not have a known result.
# - A model is prepared by deducing structures present in the input data.
# - This may be to extract general rules. It may be through a mathematical

# %% Semi-Supervised Learning
# - Input data is a mixture of labeled and unlabelled examples.
# - There is a desired prediction problem but the model must learn the structures
