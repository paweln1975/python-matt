#%% Abstract Interface
# Python don't have interfaces, although you can achieve similar effect
# Since Python 3.8 there are Protocols, which effectively are interfaces
# Interfaces cannot be instantiated
# Interfaces can be implemented
# Implemented class must define all interface methods (implement interface)
# Only public method declaration



#%% Problem



#%% Solution
# S.O.L.I.D.
# DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
# Always depend on an abstraction not con



#%% Interface Names
# Cache
# CacheInterface
# CacheIface
# ICache



#%% Alternative Notation



#%% Not Existing Notation
# This currently does not exists in Python
# In fact it is not even a valid Python syntax
# But it could greatly improve readability
