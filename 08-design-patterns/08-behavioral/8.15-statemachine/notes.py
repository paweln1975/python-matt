# %% State Machine
# - EN: State Machine
# - PL: Maszyna Stan√≥w
# - Type: class
# %%



# %% Pattern
# - StateMachine imposes a structure to automatically change the implementation from one object to the next
# - The current implementation represents the state that a system is in
# - System behaves differently from one state to the next
# - The code that moves the system from one state to the next
# - Each state can be run() to perform its behavior
# - You can pass it an input object so it can tell you what new state to move to based on that input
# - Each State object decides what other states it can move to, based on the input
# - Each State object has its own little State table
# - There is a single master state transition table for the whole system
