#%% Composite
# EN: Composite
# PL: Kompozyt
# Type: object



#%% Pattern
# Represent a hierarchy of objects
# Groups (and subgroups) objects in Keynote
# Files in a Folder; when you move folder you also move files
# allows you to represent individual entities and groups of entities in the same manner.
# is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into a tree.
# is great if you need the option of swapping hierarchical relationships around.
# makes it easier for you to add new kinds of components
# conform to the Single Responsibility Principle in the way that it separates the aggregation of objects from the features of the object.
