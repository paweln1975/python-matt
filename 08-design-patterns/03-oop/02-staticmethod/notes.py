#%% OOP Staticmethod
# Should **not** be in a class: method which don't use self in its body
# Should be in class: if method takes self and use it (it requires instances to work)
# If a method don't use self but uses class as a namespace use @staticmethod decorator
# Using class as namespace
# No need to create a class instance
# Will not pass instance (self) as a first method argument



#%% Problem



#%% Solution



#%% Dataclass



#%% Namespace



#%% To @staticmethod or Not
