# %% Auth Passkey
# - WebAuthn
# - Public Key Cryptography
# - Industry Standard (FIDO Alliance, W3C Standard)
# - Strong credentials. Every passkey is strong. They're never guessable, reused, or weak.
# - Safe from server leaks. Because servers only keep public keys, servers are less valuable targets for hackers.
# - Safe from phishing. Passkeys are intrinsically linked with the app or website they were created for, so people can never be tricked into using their passkey to sign in to a fraudulent app or website.
# - In iCloud Keychain, passkeys are end-to-end encrypted, so even Apple can't read them. A passkey ensures a strong, private relationship between a person and your app or website.
