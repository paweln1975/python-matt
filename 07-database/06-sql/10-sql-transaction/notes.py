#%% SQL Transaction
# Any command that accesses the database will automatically start a transaction
# Automatically started transactions are committed when the last SQL statement finishes
# Transactions can be started manually using the BEGIN command.
# Transactions usually persist until the next COMMIT or ROLLBACK command.
# ACID - four standard properties
# Atomicity
# Consistency
# Isolation
# Durability



#%% ACID



#%% Begin

# BEGIN or BEGIN TRANSACTION



#%% Rollback
