# %% SQLAlchemy Core Text
# %%



# %% Constructs
# - SQL Expression language constructs: select, where, join, ...
# - Composability - we can build and rearrange SQL using Python objects
# - Database agnosticism - query will run on lots of different backends
# - Support for refactoring
# %%



# %% Text
# - If you have perfect query - use text()
# - Usually for more complex queries that's very specific
# - It can be changed to SQL constructs later if needed
# - Works with the ORM too
