#%% Normalization About
# Entities - rows in database
# Attributes - columns in database
# Normalization is what gives data meaning
# NF - Normal Form
# In order to be in 3rd normal form, you need to be in 1st and 2nd NF
# Core basics: 1st, 2nd, 3rd
# Exceptions: 4th, 5th
# 1st: atomic values, unique identifiers (PK), columns with same type
# 2nd: all data must depend on the Primary Key
# 3rd: PK define all Non-Key columns, those can't depend on any other Key
# 4th: No multi-valued dependencies
