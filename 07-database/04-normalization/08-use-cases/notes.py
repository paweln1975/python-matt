#%% Recap
# DBA and Programmers use different data format than Data Scientists
# Data Scientists prefer flat formats, without relations and joins
# DBA and Programmers prefer relational data
# For DBA and Programmers flat data formats represents data duplication
# Normalization make data manipulation more consistent
# Normalization uses less space and makes UPDATEs easier
# Normalization causes a lot of SELECT and JOINs, which requires computation
# In XXI century storage is cheap, computing power cost money
# Currently SELECTs are far more common than INSERTs and UPDATEs (let say
