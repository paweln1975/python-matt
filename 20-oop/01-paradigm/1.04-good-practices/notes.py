# %% Tell - don't ask
# - Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions that operate on that data.
# - It reminds us that rather than asking an object for data and acting on that data, we should instead tell an object what to do.
# - This encourages to move behavior into an object to go with the data.

# - More information in Protocol Reflection
# - More information in Protocol Descriptor
# - In Python you prefer direct attribute access
