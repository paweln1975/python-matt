#%% Line Comments
# :pep:8 -- Style Guide for Python Code: for line comments: Hash (#), space and then comment



#%% Multiline Comments
# There are no multiline comments in Python
# You can create many one line comments



#%% Inline Comments
# :pep:8 -- Style Guide for Python Code: for inline comments: code, two spaces, hash (#), space and then comment



#%% Docstring and Doctests
# Docstring is a first multiline comment in: File/Module, Class, Method/Function
# Used for doctest
# More information in Function Doctest
# :pep:257 -- Docstring Conventions: For multiline str always use three double quote (""") characters



#%% Good Practices
# If you need comments, you failed with writing clean code
# Instead of comments write more readable code
# Never commit commented out code
# Use Version Control System instead - e.g.: git blame
# IDE has Local history (modifications) and you can compare file
