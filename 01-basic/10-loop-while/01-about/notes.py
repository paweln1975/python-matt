#%% Loop While About
# Iterate over sequences (iterables)
# Repeat if until result is False



#%% Syntax
# Continue execution when argument is True
# Stops if argument is False



#%% Getitem with Const



#%% Getitem with Variable



#%% Getitem with Boundary Checking



#%% While Loop



#%% Sequence Iteration



#%% Good Practices
# The longer the loop scope, the longer the variable name should be
# Avoid one letters if scope is longer than one line
# Use i for loop counter (it is traditional name in almost all languages)
