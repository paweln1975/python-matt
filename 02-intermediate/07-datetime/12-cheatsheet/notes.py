# from datetime import datetime, date, time, timedelta, timezone
# datetime(year, month, day, hour, minute, second, microsecond, tzinfo) - Create a datetime object
# date(year, month, day) - Create a date object
# time(hour, minute, second, microsecond) - Create a time object
# date.today() - Get the current date
# datetime.now() - Get the current date and time
# datetime.now(timezone.utc) - Get the current date and time in UTC
# datetime.datetime.strptime('1969-07-21 02:56:15', '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Parse a string into a datetime object
# dt.isoformat() - Get the current date and time in ISO 8601 format
# dt.strftime(dt, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - Format a datetime object as a string
