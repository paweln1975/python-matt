#%% Logging Config Basic
# filename - Specifies that a FileHandler be created, using the specified filename, rather than a StreamHandler
# filemode - If filename is specified, open the file in this mode. Defaults to 'a'
# format - Use the specified format string for the handler
# datefmt - Use the specified date/time format, as accepted by time.strftime()
# style - If format is specified, use this style for the format string. One of '%', '{' or '$' for printf-style, str.format() or string.Template respectively. Defaults to '%'
# level - Set the root logger level to the specified level
# stream - Use the specified stream to initialize the StreamHandler. Note that this argument is incompatible with filename - if both are present, a ValueError is raised
# handlers - If specified, this should be an iterable of already created handlers to add to the root logger. Any handlers which don't already have a formatter set will be assigned the default formatter created in this function. Note that this argument is incompatible with filename or stream - if both are present, a ValueError is raised
