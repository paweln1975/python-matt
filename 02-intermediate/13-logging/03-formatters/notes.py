# message - The logged message, computed as msg % args. This is set when Formatter.format is invoked



#%% Dates
# asctime - Human-readable time when LogRecord was created, example: 1969-07-21 02:56:15,123
# created - Time when the LogRecord was created (as returned by time.time)
# msecs - Millisecond portion of the time when the LogRecord was created



#%% File and Module
# pathname - Full pathname of the source file where the logging call was issued (if available)
# filename - Filename portion of pathname
# module - Module (name portion of filename)
# funcName - Name of function containing the logging call
# lineno - Source line number where the logging call was issued (if available)



#%% Process and Thread
# process - Process ID (if available)
# processName - Process name (if available)
# thread - Thread ID (if available)
# threadName - Thread name (if available)



#%% Other
# You shouldn't need to format this yourself
# args - The tuple of arguments merged into msg to produce message, or a dict whose values are used for the merge (when there is only one argument, and it is a dictionary)
# exc_info - Exception tuple (Ã  la sys.exc_info) if no exception has occurred, None
# msg - The format string passed in the original logging call. Merged with args to produce message, or an arbitrary object
# stack_info - Stack frame information (where available) from the bottom of the stack in the current thread, up to and including the stack frame of the logging call which resulted in the creation of this record
# levelno - Numeric logging level for the message (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
# relativeCreated - Time in milliseconds when the LogRecord was created, relative to the time the logging module was loaded



#%% Date Format



#%% Log Style
# { - curly brackets; compare to f-string formatting
# % - percent sign; compare to formatting string with %
# $ - dollar sign; compare to template vars from other languages
# Default mode is % percent
