# %% Statistics Descriptive
# %%



# %% Mean
# - Compute the arithmetic mean along the specified axis.
# - The arithmetic mean is the sum of the elements along the axis divided by the number of elements.
# - The average is taken over the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
# %%



# %% Average
# - Compute the weighted average along the specified axis.
# %%



# %% Median
# - Compute the median along the specified axis
# %%



# %% Variance
# - Compute the variance along the specified axis.
# - Variance of the array elements is a measure of the spread of a distribution.
# - The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, i.e., var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2)
# - The variance is computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
# %%



# %% Standard Deviation
# - Compute the standard deviation along the specified axis.
# - Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a distribution, of the array elements.
# - The standard deviation is the square root of the average of the squared deviations from the mean, i.e., std = sqrt(mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2))
# - The standard deviation is computed for the flattened array by default, otherwise over the specified axis.
# %%



# %% Covariance
# - Estimate a covariance matrix, given data and weights
# - Covariance indicates the level to which two variables vary together
# - ddof - Delta Degrees of Freedom
# %%



# %% Correlation coefficient
# - measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y
# - Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)
# - Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC)
# - bivariate correlation
