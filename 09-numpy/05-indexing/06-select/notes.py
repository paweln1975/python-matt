#%% Array Select



#%% Unique



#%% Diagonal



#%% Nonzero
# Each element of the tuple contains one of the indices for each nonzero value.
# Therefore, the length of each tuple element is the number of nonzeros in the array.
# The first element of the tuple is the first index for each of the nonzero values: ([0, 0, 1, 1]).
# The second element of the tuple is the second index for each of the nonzero values: ([0, 2, 0, 2]).
# Pairs are zipped (first and second tuple):



#%% Where
# where(boolarray)
# indexes of elements



#%% Multiple argument
# where(boolarray, truearray, falsearray):
