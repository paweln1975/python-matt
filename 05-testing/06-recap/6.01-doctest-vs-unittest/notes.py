# %% Testing Doctest vs Unittest
# %%



# %% Code
# %%



# %% Doctest
# - Primary focus on documentation
# - Shows how to use the code (your API)
# %%



# %% Unittest
# - Testing each possible action
# - Unit does not refer to the size of the test (single class)
# - Unit refers to the smallest testable part of the application (feature)
# - Split tests into separate classes by feature (test cases)
